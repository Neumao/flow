Work Item Workflows (with audit/history)
Create Work Item

Any permitted user can create a new work item.
Update Work Item

Permitted users can update title/description of a work item.
State Transitions (Lifecycle)

Move work items through defined states:
NEW → IN_PROGRESS
IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW
REVIEW → DONE, REWORK, BLOCKED, CANCELLED
REWORK → IN_PROGRESS, CANCELLED
BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS (unblock)
Any → CANCELLED (with justification)
Only allowed transitions are permitted; invalid transitions are rejected.
Block Work Item

Mark a work item as blocked with a reason.
While blocked, no state transitions except unblocking are allowed.
Unblock Work Item

Unblock a blocked work item (returns to previous or allowed state).
Request Rework

From REVIEW, send a work item to REWORK with justification.
View Work Item History (Audit Trail)

See all state changes, blocking/unblocking, and rework events for each work item.
Role-Based Access Control
All workflows must enforce role-based permissions:
Only users with the correct role can perform each action (create, update, transition, block, unblock, rework, cancel).
Users can only see and act on work items they are permitted to access.
Edge Cases to Test
Multiple updates close together (concurrency)
State changes while viewing a work item
Invalid or outdated data submission (should be rejected and clearly communicated)
