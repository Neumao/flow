1. Create Work Item

Any permitted user can create a new work item.
Verify audit/history is recorded.

2. Update Work Item

Permitted users can update title/description.
Unauthorized users are rejected.
Audit/history is updated.

3. State Transitions (Lifecycle)

Test all allowed transitions:
NEW → IN_PROGRESS
IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW
REVIEW → DONE, REWORK, BLOCKED, CANCELLED
REWORK → IN_PROGRESS, CANCELLED
BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS (unblock)
Any → CANCELLED (with justification)
Attempt invalid transitions (should be rejected and error shown).
Ensure only permitted roles can perform each transition.

4. Block/Unblock Work Item
   Block a work item with a reason (permitted roles only).
   While blocked, no transitions except unblock are allowed.
   Unblock returns to allowed state.
   Audit/history records block/unblock events.
5. Request Rework

From REVIEW, send to REWORK with justification (permitted roles only).
Only allowed from REVIEW state.

6. View Work Item History

All state changes, block/unblock, and rework events are visible in audit/history.

7. Role-Based Access Control

Only users with correct role can perform each action.
Users can only see and act on permitted work items.

8. Edge Cases

Multiple updates close together (concurrency): Only latest valid update is accepted.
State changes while viewing a work item: UI should handle and communicate if the item has changed or is outdated.
Invalid or outdated data submission: Should be rejected and error clearly communicated to the user.

9. Error Handling

All errors (permission, invalid state, outdated data) are shown in the UI with clear messages.
